Ideas


Rules of level design:
Never introduce more than 2 mechanics at a time and even then ideally they are related.
Reinforce the idea. Ideally make them do that action / interact with the mechnic a couple of times in the level / subsequent levels.


Bridge:

Enemies:
- Bats
- Rats

Mechanics:
- Arrows?
- Falling Blocks
- Wind Shoots

- Moving Platforms

- Raising sections of bridge by completing little "tasks"




OLD TODO
Gate level
- intro: we establish that our goat friends have gone missing in the castle

Bridge level
- just learning more mechanics

Kitchen level
- picking up food, finding it
- we encounter a monster hunter at the end of the stage

Dock level
- we see the main food monster is kidnapping our goat friends

Conservatory level
- we learn a song (by jumping on music notes)
- we also construct an instrument along the way
- we have to put the instrument into something (maybe a wind shooty thing) to make the notes appear
    - once the notes appear we have to play a song to open the doors to the tower

Tower level
- a single level with the camera scrolling up, we have to jump and navigate up the tower fast
- we meet the hunter again at the bottom of the tower, he tells us of an ancient prophecy that will reveal how to slay the beast
- we get to the top, the moon beams align just right to show us a single salt shaker on the floor, the secret is revealed!

Dungeon level
- we unlock the dungeon with the musical instrument
- we fight the monster, the hunter is throwing salt up in the air, we bounce on them to hit the monster with salt
-  the beast is defeated, we save the goats
